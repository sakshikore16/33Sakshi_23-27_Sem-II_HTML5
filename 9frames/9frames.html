<!-- 9. Use frames such that page is divided into 3 frames 20% 
on left to show contents of pages, 60% in center to show body of 
page, remaining on right to show remarks. -->

<!-- Theory: 
By utilizing the <frameset> element with the cols attribute to 
partition the webpage horizontally, and embedding separate <frame> 
elements with distinct source documents, this code creates a framed 
layout, facilitating the simultaneous presentation of multiple 
webpages for improved content organization and navigation. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Framed Page</title>
  </head>
  <frameset cols="20%,60%,20%">
    <frame src="frame1.html" name="frame1">
    <frame src="frame2.html" name="frame2">
    <frame src="frame3.html" name="frame3">
  </frameset>
</html>

<!-- Conclusion: 
This HTML code defines a frameset divided into three columns, each 
containing a separate HTML document loaded into frames named "frame1," 
"frame2," and "frame3," enabling the display of multiple webpages 
simultaneously within a single browser window. -->
